### Hey! I'm a cat lover and outgoing guy, and also a Backend Software Engineer with some frontend experience. Aspiring to always be open-minded and solution-oriented, keeping my eagerness to learn new things.

I really like the Node.js ecosystem, passionate about Javascript and Typescript while my favorite framework is NestJS. I had a good experience with PHP and Laravel too :)
On the Frontend, I've already used VueJS, React and React Native.

Last but not least, in DevOps I have experience with Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Kibana and Confluent. Also some minor experience with Cloud Infrastructure like AWS and GCP.

I have experience in Agile development and Scrum methodologies.

Feel free to check out some of my projects (pinned or not) on Github: https://github.com/YgorAlves
